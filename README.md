# Reflection

- Currently missing validation, sorting, statistics, saving to local storage. If there's time on 8/5 I'll try to do that.

1. Used components to build the page, React Bootstrap for design. Tried figuring out the structure, but stil struggling with some components, questioning why I need a dashboard at all in this. Haven't added anything to utils as I haven't also researched what's supposed to go in there.
2. Most challenging was dashboard. For now, I haven't met all the requirements yet. For the other components I've used information from the previous lab and dashboard seemed like an unneccessary wrapper so it took some time trying to figure props. Haven't done utils as for now I'm not 100% clear what goes in there. I think I had the same problem with regular js projects.
3. I've figured my app will have the state and the components will have their own little states needed specifically for them to function, but main logis is all in the app as it seems like that's the main parent.
